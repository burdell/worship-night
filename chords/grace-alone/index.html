      <h1>Grace Alone</h1>
      <div>
        <div class="verse">
          <p>I was an orphan, lost at the fall</p>
          <p>Running away when I’d hear You call</p>
          <p>But Father, you worked your will</p>
          <p>I had no righteousness of my own</p>
          <p>I had no right to draw near Your throne</p>
          <p>But Father, You loved me still</p>
          <p>And in love, before You laid the world’s foundation</p>
          <p>You predestined to adopt me as Your own</p>
          <p>You have raised me so high above my station</p>
          <p>I’m a child of God by grace and grace alone</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
          <p>You left your home to seek out the lost</p>
          <p>You knew the great and terrible cost</p>
          <p>But Jesus, Your face was set</p>
          <p>I worked my fingers down to the bone</p>
          <p>But nothing I did could ever atone</p>
          <p>But Jesus, You paid my debt</p>
          <p>By Your blood I have redemption and salvation</p>
          <p>Lord you died that I might reap what you have sown</p>
          <p>And you rose that I might be a new creation</p>
          <p>I am born again by grace and grace alone</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
          <p>I was in darkness all of my life</p>
          <p>I never knew the day from the night</p>
          <p>But Spirit, You made me see</p>
          <p>I swore I knew the way on my own</p>
          <p>A head full of rocks, a heart made of stone</p>
          <p>But Spirit, You moved in me</p>
          <p>And at Your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened</p>
          <p>On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone</p>
          <p>Called into a kingdom that cannot be shaken</p>
          <p>I will stand in faith by grace and grace alone</p>
          <p>I’ll be strong in You by grace, and grace alone</p>
          <p>Every breath I’ll breathe by grace, and grace alone</p>
          <p>I’m a child of God by grace and grace alone</p>
          <p>I will stand in faith by grace and grace alone</p>
